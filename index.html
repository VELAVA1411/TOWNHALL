				Author of the critically acclaimed best seller, The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the 
				Supreme Court, Jeffrey Toobin brings the inside story of one of America's most mysterious 
				and powerful institutions to the Saroyan stage. At the podium, Toobin is an unbiased, deeply 
				analytic expert on American law, politics and procedure and he provides a unique look into the 
				inner workings of the Supreme Court and its influence.

				Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court was published by Doubleday and spent more than 
				four months on the NY Times best-seller list, earning Toobin the 2008 J. Anthony Lukas Prize 
				for Nonfiction from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. Toobin has also written several 
				other best-selling books, including A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal that 
				Nearly Brought Down a President; The Run of His Life: The People vs. O.J. Simpson; and 
				Too Close to Call: The 36-Day Battle to Decide the 2000 Election.

				Jeffrey Toobin joined CBB from ABC News, where, during his six-year tenure as a legal analyst, 
				he provided legal views on the nation's most provocative and high profile cases, including the O.J. 
				Simpson civil trial and the Kenneth Starr investigation of the Clinton White House. Toobin 
				received a 2001 Emmy Award for his coverage of the Elian Gonzales custody saga.

				Toobin is a staff writer at The New Yorker and has been covering legal affairs for the magazine 
				since 1993. He has written articles on such subjects as Attorney General John Ashcroft, the 2001 
				dispute over Florida's votes for president, the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, and Supreme 
				Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
